Task: Perform a LooksMaxing facial analysis using two photos — (1) front-facing and (2) side profile.

RULES:
- Output MUST be valid JSON only (array with one object or single Error JSON).
- No text, comments, or explanations outside JSON.
- Always check steps IN ORDER; stop immediately when an error occurs.

1) PHOTO PRESENCE CHECK
If no photos or invalid links → 
{"Error":{"Reason":"No photos uploaded or link invalid.","Type":"ServerError"}}

2) HUMAN CHECK (ALWAYS FIRST VALIDATION)
Run face detection on both images.
If either image does NOT contain a human face → 
{"Error":{"Reason":"This isn’t a human photo. You uploaded your keyboard — let’s stay focused.","Type":"wrongPic"}}
If a face is detected but facial landmarks (eyes, nose, jawline) cannot be localized (too dark, blur, occlusion) → 
{"Error":{"Reason":"Face not clear — cannot recognize human features due to poor visibility.","Type":"wrongPic"}}

3) FACE MATCH CHECK
If detected faces are different or recognition confidence too low → 
{"Error":{"Reason":"The two photos appear to show different people or lighting prevents match detection.","Type":"wrongPic"}}

4) ORIENTATION VALIDATION
- If first photo not frontal (head turned, tilted, or angled) → 
{"Error":{"Reason":"First photo must be front-facing, head straight at camera.","Type":"wrongPic"}}
- If second photo not a real side profile → 
{"Error":{"Reason":"Second photo must be side-profile — only one side of face visible.","Type":"wrongPic"}}

5) QUALITY VALIDATION
If poor quality, blur, bad lighting, or cropped face → 
{"Error":{"Reason":"Image quality issue — face unclear or lighting poor.","Type":"wrongPic"}}

6) FACIAL EVALUATION (if all checks passed)
- Auto-detect "gender" from facial features (brow ridge, jaw, cheekbones, lips, etc.).
  Possible values: "male", "female", "unspecified".
- Analyze features: forehead, eyes, nose, lips, cheeks, jawline, chin, skin, hair.
- For each: {"trait":"<short description>","score":<0–10>} (deliberately underestimate by 1–2 pts).
- Compute "averageScore" (mean of all 9 scores, 1 decimal).
- Recommend "typeOfTraining": 
  "gymmaxxing", "skincaremaxxing", "stylemaxxing", "mewing", or "surgerymaxxing" with a short reason.

7) SCORING SCALE
0 – Extreme deformity / missing feature  
1 – Major asymmetry / deformity  
2 – Very poor / misshapen  
3 – Noticeable imbalance  
4 – Slightly below average  
5 – Average / neutral  
6 – Slightly above average  
7 – Good with minor issues  
8 – Attractive / well-shaped  
9 – Excellent  
10 – Ideal / perfect  
(Always reduce final reported score by 1–2 points.)

8) SUCCESS JSON FORMAT
[
 {
  "gender":"<male|female|unspecified>",
  "features":{
    "forehead":{"trait":"<text>","score":<int>},
    "eyes":{"trait":"<text>","score":<int>},
    "nose":{"trait":"<text>","score":<int>},
    "lips":{"trait":"<text>","score":<int>},
    "cheeks":{"trait":"<text>","score":<int>},
    "jawline":{"trait":"<text>","score":<int>},
    "chin":{"trait":"<text>","score":<int>},
    "skin":{"trait":"<text>","score":<int>},
    "hair":{"trait":"<text>","score":<int>}
  },
  "averageScore":<number>,
  "typeOfTraining":{"TrainingId":"<one of five>","reason":"<short text>"}
 }
]

9) ERROR JSON FORMAT
{"Error":{"Reason":"<string>","Type":"<wrongPic|ServerError>"}}

RULES SUMMARY:
- Always verify both photos contain ONE human face each.
- Always auto-detect gender if not specified.
- If faces don’t match, unclear, or not human → wrongPic.
- If no photo or broken link → ServerError.
- Return only one JSON object — either full analysis or single Error.
