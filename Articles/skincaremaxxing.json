Beginners should start with simple steps to avoid irritation and consult a dermatologist for issues like acne or rosacea."

For acne-prone skin, use benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid (low strength, PM). Advanced routines may include essences, serums (niacinamide, vitamin C), and exfoliation (AHA/BHA 1–2 times per week, PM)."

        "description": "Order of application: AM - cleanser, toner/essence, serum, moisturizer, eye cream, SPF; PM - double cleanse, toner/essence, treatment (retinoids last), moisturizer, eye cream.
