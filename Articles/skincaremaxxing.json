This approach emphasizes cleansing, hydration, protection, and treatment to achieve clear, even-toned, youthful skin, combining daily regimens with nutrition and sun avoidance."

        "description": "Key points: Establish a consistent routine tailored to your skin type (normal, dry, oily, combination, sensitive), incorporate sunscreen daily, focus on gentle products, and maintain a balanced diet with hydration. Beginners should start simple to avoid irritation and consult a dermatologist for persistent issues like acne."

For acne-prone skin, incorporate benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid (start low strength, PM). Advanced glass skin adds essences, serums (niacinamide, vitamin C), and exfoliation (AHA/BHA 1-2x/week, PM)."

Combine with nutrition (veggies, probiotics for gut-skin axis) and habits (7-9 hours sleep, stress management)."
