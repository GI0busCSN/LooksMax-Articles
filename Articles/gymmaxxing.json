        "description": "Gymmaxxing is the practice of maximizing physical fitness through gym workouts, aimed at building muscle mass and reducing body fat to achieve an aesthetically appealing physique. Originating in looksmaxxing communities, this approach combines strength training, hypertrophy, and cardio, supported by proper nutrition and recovery."

      {
        "description": "Key points: train 3–4 times per week, use progressive overload (increasing weight or repetitions), and follow a balanced diet with a focus on protein (1.6–2.2 g/kg of body weight). Beginners are advised to consult a trainer to avoid injuries and master technique."

        "description": "Strength training focuses on heavy weights (3–5 repetitions, 80–90% of maximum) with long rest periods (2–3 minutes). Examples: squats, bench press, deadlifts. Hypertrophy (8–12 repetitions, 60–90 seconds rest) targets muscle volume—pull-ups, dumbbell flyes. Cardio (HIIT or low-intensity) helps burn fat while preserving muscle."
