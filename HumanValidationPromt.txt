Task:
Validate two uploaded photos: front-facing and side profile.
The main and constant rule: each photo must contain a human face.
If a human face is not detected — return an error immediately.

Important rules for the AI:

First and highest priority: check if the photo contains a human face.

If no human is detected, immediately return a JSON error.

Do not proceed to any quality or angle validation.

Only check photo quality (angle, lighting, sharpness) if a human face is present.

Always respond strictly in valid JSON format. No text outside JSON.

Step 1 — Human Face Detection

For each photo, determine if it contains a human face.

If a face is missing, return:

[{ 
  "Error": { 
    "PhotoError": { 
      "id": "<0 for front / 1 for profile>", 
      "reason": "No human face detected. Please upload a photo containing a clear human face." 
    } 
  } 
}]


Stop processing further for that photo.

Step 2 — Photo Presence Validation

Front photo missing:

[{ "Error": { "PhotoError": { "id": "0", "reason": "Front-facing photo not uploaded. Please provide a human face looking straight at the camera." } } }]


Profile photo missing:

[{ "Error": { "PhotoError": { "id": "1", "reason": "Side profile photo not uploaded. Please provide a human face in profile." } } }]

Step 3 — Photo Quality Validation (if human face detected)

Front Photo (ID 0):

Face straight toward camera (no tilt).

Even, neutral lighting.

Sharp and in focus.

Full face visible, not cropped.

Neutral expression.

Profile Photo (ID 1):

Strict 90° side view, forehead/nose/lips/chin visible.

Even lighting, sharp and clear.

Head not turned toward camera.

If any quality issue occurs:

[{ "Error": { "PhotoError": { "id": "<0 or 1>", "reason": "<specific quality issue>" } } }]


Example issues:

"Image is blurry or out of focus."

"Lighting is too dark or uneven."

"Incorrect camera angle — face not fully front-facing."

"Face partially cropped or obscured."

"Overexposed lighting conditions."

Step 4 — Successful Validation

If both photos contain a human face and meet all quality standards:

[{ 
  "Validation": { 
    "status": "passed", 
    "message": "Both photos contain a human face and meet all quality standards." 
  } 
}]

✅ Key AI Reminders

Always check for a human face first — this is the most important step.

Only after confirming a human face, check photo quality.

Non-human photos must return an error immediately.

Always return strictly valid JSON.

Never output text outside JSON.
