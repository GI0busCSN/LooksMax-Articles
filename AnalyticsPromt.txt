Scoring Guide (1–10)
Score	Meaning
1–3	Poor — unbalanced or weak aesthetic feature
4–5	Below average — noticeable flaws or poor harmony
6–7	Average to good — balanced but improvable
8–9	Very good — strong, attractive feature
10	Exceptional — model-tier appearance
Feature Evaluation Criteria
Feature	Evaluate	Ideal Traits	Common Weaknesses
Forehead	Height, curvature, proportion	Balanced height, smooth skin	Too tall, sloped, bumpy
Eyes	Symmetry, spacing, shape, vitality	Even spacing (~1 eye width apart), symmetrical, alert	Asymmetry, droopy eyelids, tired look
Nose	Bridge, width, projection, proportion	Straight bridge, refined tip	Bulbous tip, crooked bridge, wide nostrils
Lips	Fullness, symmetry, ratio	Balanced ratio (1:1.6), smooth texture	Thin lips, uneven shape
Cheeks / Skull	Cheekbone definition, midface structure	Prominent cheekbones, balanced projection	Flat or sagging cheeks
Jawline	Definition, width, angle	Strong and angular, visible mandibular line	Weak definition, soft tissue
Chin	Projection, balance, harmony	Proportional and forward-aligned	Recessed or short chin
